** compare parametrization of probabilities to parametrization of triangles
** A Nietzschean Critique of Cartesion Probability Metrics
Nietzsche criticizes Descartes for elevating an artifice of grammar
(the Cartesian ego) to a foundation for metaphysics. There is a
tendency in the literature of formal epistemology to understand
categorical probability distributions geometrically in terms of
Cartesian coordinates. The $n-1$-dimensional simplex becomes the
manifold of categorical probability distributions for $n$ categories,
and the individual probabilities associated with the categories are
represented by the Cartesian coordinates of points on the simplex.

Descartes the tausendsassa.
