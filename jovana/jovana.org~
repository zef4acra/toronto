** compare parametrization of probabilities to parametrization of triangles
** A Nietzschean Critique of Cartesion Probability Metrics
Nietzsche criticizes Descartes for elevating an artifice of grammar
(the Cartesian ego) to a foundation for metaphysics. There is a
tendency in the literature of formal epistemology to understand
categorical probability distributions geometrically in terms of
Cartesian coordinates. The $n-1$-dimensional simplex becomes the
manifold of categorical probability distributions for $n$ categories,
and the individual probabilities associated with the categories are
represented by the Cartesian coordinates of points on the simplex.

Descartes the tausendsassa.

For the new year. I still live, I still think: I still have to live,
for I still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum. Today
everybody permits himself the expression of his wish and his dearest
thought; hence I, too, shall say what it is that I wish from myself
today, and what was the first thought to run across my heart this
year---what thought shall be for me the reason, warranty, and sweetness
of my life henceforth. I want to learn more and more to see as
beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those
who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth!
I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to
accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away
shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I
wish to be only a Yes-sayer. (Gay Science, Aphorism 276)

When I analyse the event expressed in the sentence ``I think,'' I
acquire a series of rash assertions which are difficult, perhaps
impossible, to prove---for example, that it is I who think, that it
has to be something at all which thinks, that thinking is an activity
and operation on the part of an entity thought as a cause, that ``I''
exists, finally that what is designed by ``thinking'' has already been
determined---that I know what thinking is. (Beyond Good and Evil, Section 46)

Why couldn't the world that concerns us be a fiction? And if somebody
asked, ``but to a fiction there surely belongs an author?''---
couldn't one answer simply: why? Doesn't this ``belongs'' perhaps
belong to the fiction, too? Is it not permitted to be a bit ironical
about the subject no less than the predicate and object? Shouldn't
philosophers be permitted to rise above faith in grammar? All due
respect for governesses---but hasn't the time come for philosophy to
renounce the faith of governesses? (Beyond Good and Evil, Section 34)
